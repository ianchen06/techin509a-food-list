Steak: Pho bo is traditionally made with thinly sliced steak that is cooked in the simmering broth in each individual serving bowl. In order to very thinly slice the steak, I recommend popping the steak in the freezer for about 45-60 minutes, then slicing it against the grain as thinly as possible. (Alternately, you can ask the butcher to thinly slice your steak for you, or add pre-cooked steak to your soup.)

Thin rice noodles: Pho is traditionally made with thin rice noodles, such as these. In order to prevent the noodles from overcooking in the broth, itâ€™s traditional to cook pho noodles separately on their own. Then the noodles will be added to each individual serving bowl, followed by the protein, hot broth and toppings.
