# Classic Roast Chicken

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken (about 4-5 pounds)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 1 onion, quartered
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed
- Fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, parsley) for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Remove giblets from the chicken cavity and pat the chicken dry with paper towels.
   - Season the chicken inside and out with salt and black pepper.

3. **Seasoning Mix:**
   - In a small bowl, mix together paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and olive oil to create a paste.

4. **Rub the Chicken:**
   - Rub the seasoning paste all over the chicken, ensuring it's well-coated.

5. **Stuff the Chicken:**
   - Place lemon quarters, onion quarters, and smashed garlic cloves inside the chicken cavity.

6. **Tie the Legs:**
   - If you have kitchen twine, tie the legs of the chicken together. This helps the chicken cook evenly.

7. **Roasting:**
   - Place the chicken on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).

8. **Basting (Optional):**
   - Baste the chicken with pan juices every 20-30 minutes for a golden and flavorful skin.

9. **Resting:**
   - Once cooked, let the chicken rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving.

10. **Serve:**
    - Carve the chicken and garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
