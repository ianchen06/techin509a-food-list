"Great taste, and value for money during this inflationary market!
It's been awhile since I visited (pre pandemic) and I expected smaller portions or reduced taste, as is common with many restaurants these days. That being said I was pleasantly surprised when visiting on a Friday night, The server is polite and quick as well. We had enough food for 2 of us that we had to get a to go box, which, was also of very high quality.
If you're in the good for fried chicken, get the popcorn chicken set, otherwise marinated chicken is flavorful. The "lions head" 狮子头 is very tasty and much larger than nearby places serving this!"

"Wow - good place to enjoy some Asian cuisine. The crispy chicken was spicy and delicious, their Taiwan noodles was spot on and their clams was tasty. Left satisfied"
